## 🎯 Overview

KR Studio merges **modern rendering pipelines** with **robotics simulation** and **database-driven asset management**.  
It’s not just a visualization tool — it’s a full **development environment** for building, testing, and refining robotics systems before committing to hardware.

## ✨ Features

### 🖥 Rendering
- **Deferred rendering pipeline** with geometry, lighting, and post-processing passes.
- **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)**:
  - HDR environment sampling
  - Image-Based Lighting (IBL) with irradiance & prefiltered cubemaps
  - BRDF LUT integration
- Advanced material system:
  - Albedo, metalness, roughness, AO, emissive
  - Refraction, reflectance, anisotropy (WIP)
- Debug-friendly: every pass is isolated for RenderDoc capture.

### 🧩 Multi-Viewport UI
- Built on **Qt** + **Advanced Docking System (ADS)**.
- Multiple independent viewports with separate cameras and rendering states.
- Persistent dock layouts per workspace.
- Toolbar/menu synchronization.

---

### 📦 Scene & Asset Management
- **SQLite** asset database with metadata tracking.
- On-demand mesh loading via **Assimp**.
- Hybrid CPU/GPU cache with automatic cleanup.
- Scene graph with fast lookup and lazy asset binding.

---

### 🛠 Node-Based Editing
- Powered by **QtNodes**.
- For logic graphs, material graphs, and procedural asset pipelines.
- Real-time updates directly in the viewport.

🔨 Build Instructions
Prerequisites
CMake ≥ 3.21
Qt ≥ 6.x
OpenGL ≥ 4.5 capable GPU

vcpkg for dependencies

git clone https://github.com/KaedinKurtz/KRStudio.git

cd KRStudio

# Release build (use this for normal development — Debug builds render at a fraction of the framerate)
cmake --preset windows-ninja-release
cmake --build --preset release

# Debug build (only when you need a debugger; expect low FPS)
cmake --preset windows-ninja-debug
cmake --build --preset debug
