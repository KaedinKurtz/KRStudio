Welcome! I am in the long process of creating a fully integrated, fully featured robotics workstation tool. This will have all of the juicy features you could
hope for including simulation, kinematic solvers, active controllers, data filtering, state space models, belief filters, path planning, point cloud processing, 
and MUCH more! Here are the pics (I will update them occassionally when major UI changes happen), but these are here to give you a rough idea of the layout and
look of the software. Follow along! I am using OpenGL and Qt to make the software itself, and clawing tooth and nail through fleshing out a stable OpenGL
rendering pipeline.

perspective AND orthogonal views
AND the gridlines dissapear as you zoom out

everything including colors, zoom fades, angles and origins, are all customizable by the user
and you can get REALLY small

there are 1000 of those small cubes in each of the large orange ones from the first two pics... that is 5 orders of magnitude of grid pixel!!!
